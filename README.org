* Referral codes

This is a crate largely inspired by the [[https://www.npmjs.com/package/referral-codes][referral-codes]] library on NPM.

The usage is similar. You can either use the default config

#+begin_src rust
  let config = Config::default();
#+end_src

Or define your own

#+begin_src rust
  let config = Config {
      charset: Charset::Alphanumeric,
      count: 3,
      pattern: Pattern::Length(8),
  }
#+end_src

Then, you can call =generate_one= to generate a single referral code,
or you can call =generate= to generate =count= referral codes,
according to the configuration defined above.
